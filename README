rsgen
=====

A simple utility, which generates random strings.

This utility is Unicode-aware, which means that
it understands all the character encodings supported by the iconv
and it can generate files containing the random strings made of
random characters instead of just random bytes.

This application provides a single executable:
rsgen	outputs a file containing the desired number of random characters
	generated using the specified type of pseudorandom number generator

Requirements:
-------------

For compiling:

C++ compiler and libraries at least partially conforming
to the 2011 ISO C++ standard (C++11), because of:
	- the type unsigned long long

and also at least partially conforming to the POSIX.1-2001 standard,
because of:
	- function iconv and related stuff
	- function getopt and related stuff


Compilation:
------------

It should be as easy as:

make

Usage:
------

Run the compiled executable without any parameters
and follow the provided instructions.
