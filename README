rsgen
=====

A simple utility which generates pseudorandom strings.

This utility is Unicode-aware, which means that
it understands all the character encodings supported by the iconv
and it can generate files containing the pseudorandom strings made of
pseudorandom characters instead of just pseudorandom bytes.

Available pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) are:

	1. Mersenne twister (as implemented by the randomc library,
				http://www.agner.org/random/)
	2. random() function
	3. /dev/urandom system file

Generated pseudorandom strings can contain either
the user-supplied characters or a continuous subset
of Unicode starting at the character 0x0100.

This application provides a single executable:
rsgen	outputs a file containing the desired number
	of pseudorandom characters generated using
	the specified type of pseudorandom number generator

Requirements:
-------------

For compiling:

C++ compiler and libraries at least partially conforming
to the 2011 ISO C++ standard (C++11), because of:
	- the type unsigned long long

and also at least partially conforming to the POSIX.1-2001 standard,
because of:
	- function iconv and related stuff
	- function getopt and related stuff


Compilation:
------------

It should be as easy as:

make

Usage:
------

Run the compiled executable without any parameters
and follow the provided instructions.
